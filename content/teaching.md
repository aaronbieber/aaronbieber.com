I have always had a passion and a knack for helping people grow.

## Leadership Coaching

If you are a software engineer, new manager, or even a more seasoned leader of
people, I can help you to reach the next level of achievement through one-on-one
coaching sessions.

Visit {{< ablank "my coaching website" "https://aaronbieber.coach" >}} to learn
more and introduce yourself.

## Photography Instruction

I offer both hands-on, in-the-field workshops through 
{{< ablank "Art Photo Workshops" "https://www.artphotoworkshops.com" >}},
which I co-founded with a good friend of mine, as well as one-on-one
post-processing (Photoshop, Lightroom) help and portfolio critique via
screenshare.

If you're interested in a screenshare, please email me at aaron@aaronbieber.com
and we will find a time.
