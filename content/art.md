## Generative Works

[![Generative Art](/images/generative-art.png)](/genart)

Lately I have renewed interest in "generative art," or the creation of art
through code. You can view my [generative art gallery](/genart), which comprises
works built in the great Javascript version of the Processing environment
(so-called "p5js").

I have made photographs on and off for decades now, and I maintain a web gallery
that I'm constantly reorganizing to surface whatever I'm excited about at the
current moment. You can click the "gallery" link at the top of the site, or
[visit the gallery here](https://gallery.aaronbieber.com).

I've also written about photography and art in general for many years, although
when I get busy with other things, this blog is the first to drop off my
radar. Still, I enjoy thinking about the broader topics of art and culture, and
some of my musings may be of interest.
