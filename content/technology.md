## My Tech Blog

[![The Chronicle](/images/the-chronicle.png)](https://blog.aaronbieber.com)

I have written about technology, generally, and more recently a lot more about
Emacs (no, really) on my "personal" blog,
{{< ablank "The Chronicle" "https://blog.aaronbieber.com" >}}.
I also occasionally opine about facets of the tech industry that impact my life,
such as when Apple priced me out of their computers and I attempted to use
Windows for the first time in over 20 years and was disappointed.

## Wayfund

I am a founding member of {{< ablank "Wayfund" "http://wayfund.co" >}}, a
Boston-area tech talent syndicate working to amplify the opportunities for
entrepreneurs connected to the Wayfair engineering team's broad network.

## Advisory

I have had the opportunity to invest in and provide technical guidance to startups
and scale-up organizations in Boston. If you are in need of a "fractional CTO"
or just want to tap into my experience building software and teams, maintaining
and scaling systems, and innovating through rapid iteration, please [email
me](mailto:aaron@aaronbieber.com).

## Work History

Rather than maintain a bespoke resume, I keep my
