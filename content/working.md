In my daytime life, I am a software engineering manager. I have worked in a
variety of industries and at a variety of companies, notably Wayfair and
HubSpot. My specialty is building strategy and creating stability within teams,
which is most useful when teams are going through times of rapid growth or other
kinds of change.

I coach engineering leaders (particularly new managers) in how to cope with the
growing burden of responsibility that leadership entails. For more information
about my coaching practice, please {{< ablank "visit my website" "https://aaronbieber.coach" >}}.

## The Wayfund

I am a foundational member of The Wayfund, a Boston-area tech talent syndicate
working to amplify the opportunities for entrepreneurs connected to the Wayfair
engineering team's broad network.

## Advisory

I have had the opportunity to invest in and provide technical guidance to startups
and scale-up organizations in Boston. If you are in need of a "fractional CTO"
or just want to tap into my experience building software and teams, maintaining
and scaling systems, and innovating through rapid iteration, please [email
me](mailto:aaron@aaronbieber.com).
