I have been blogging off and on for over a decade. I have a fickle relationship
with creative writing, so I publish when the mood strikes, but have amassed
quite a pile of words.

Here they are, if you are so inclined to read them.

## Photography

My photography blog, {{< ablank "Single-Serving Photo" "https://www.singleservingphoto.com" >}},
is my longest-lived blog with its earliest post dated late-2005.

## Tech, Leadership

I have written about technology, generally, and more recently a lot more about
Emacs (no, really) on my "personal" blog,
{{< ablank "The Chronicle" "https://blog.aaronbieber.com" >}}.
I also occasionally opine about facets of the tech industry that impact my life,
such as when Apple priced me out of their computers and I attempted to use
Windows for the first time in over 20 years and was disappointed.

Recently, I started writing down some of my advice and observations about tech
leadership. If that is something you're interested in, then I suggest reading
